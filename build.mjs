// @shelacek/ubjson resolves TextEncoder/TextDecoder with a ternary operator

// it is being unconditionally loaded. This plugin marks these specific
// requires as external, which makes esbuild not try to resolve them.
//
// It is worth noting that esbuild will correctly mark requires wrapped in
// try/catch as external. It may be worthwhile to submit a PR to
// @shelacek/ubjson to change the resolution method such that it works
// as expected. (Or, to look at submitting an esbuild PR to do the same.)

// Some hacking needs to be done to make Web Workers work in esbuild:
// https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/312
//
// Specifically, the extra challenge here is that we aren't sure to have access
// to something like a /worker.js script on the server, since this web component
// can be embedded wherever. To get around this, an inline worker is created
// by taking the worker code directly, creating an object URL from it,
// constructing the worker, then revoking the temporary URL, which is done in
// workerUtil.ts.
//
// The extra complexity comes from the fact that the worker has to be bundled
// too. So we do this as the first step of the build, and then point to the
// bundled worker file (as text) when the worker is imported later.
